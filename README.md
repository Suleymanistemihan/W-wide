# W-wide
Hello everyone \o/

I'm still working on this project to build and im still learning using redux.

I think I'm making good progress on redux. As a result, there are deficiencies in the project at the moment and I will try to fix it over time.
I'll try to keep the project up-to-date so it can be reviewed as an example..

If you want to easy to look for app you can use Expo Go and there is a link for Expo;
